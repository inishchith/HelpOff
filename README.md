>Any information can be easily found by using `Google`, but `32%` of our population don't have  `Smartphone` and also there are many people having smartphone but no internet access round the clock due to which people suffer a lot for finding basic needs especially when travelling to a particularplace.  We've built a `SMS based offline system` where the user can get the required information in few basic steps by simple sending a message.
